This is a simple modular resume builder built in LaTeX. My goals are 1) transparency and 2)
modularity.

# Motivation
Almost every time I'd send out / print my resume, I'd go through a pain-staking process of
hand-picking every experience to include, tailoring my descriptions to whatever position I was
applying for at the time. At different times, I'd want to highlight my technical skills, leadership
skills, experience in education, etc, and every time, I'd need to trudge through many messy lines of
LaTeX to carefully select what I wanted.

Taking inspiration from [a friend](https://github.com/patil215/resumod) and [this nicely clean
template](https://github.com/jcolemang/LaTeX-Resume-Class), I made this LaTeX class to (hopefully)
be simple enough for anyone with basic LaTeX skills to make clean resume templates without a nest of
comments and commands.
